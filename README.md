# Sparse Matrix Operations CLI

This Python project provides a **command-line interface (CLI)** for performing operations on large **sparse matrices**. It supports:

- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Subtraction
- Matrix Multiplication

The matrices are loaded from text files and represented efficiently in memory using dictionary-based sparse storage.
